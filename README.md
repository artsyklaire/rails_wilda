# rails_wilda

Hi This is Claire. I am creating a Rails app for my course in Career Foundry. I have no idea of what my app will consist but ahead we go. In the words of another CF student "I am an experienced beginner, with years of unqualified experience". Don't expect much from me but expect everything.
